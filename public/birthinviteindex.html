<h1>Top 3 best movies according to Rahul Bhadauria</h1>
<h2>My top three fav movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Swadesh</h3>
<p>This movie is all about the sense of dedication and responsibility a persons owes toward his country.</p>
<h3> Tamasha</h3>
<p>How upbringing affects the future of the child and let him follow the goal burdened to him without his choice. And how its realisation and manifestation can bring you within you.</p>
<h3>12th Fail</h3>
<p>This movie is based on the real life incident. A journey of a person, belonging to a very backward area, dominated by illiteracy and by goons and guns, ended up becoming an IPS.</p>
